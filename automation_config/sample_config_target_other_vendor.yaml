# The order of "AndroidProducts.mk", "BoardConfig.mk" and "AndroidBoard.mk" being included
# by AOSP core makefiles:
#
# 1. First, "AndroidProducts.mk" is included, in this file "PRODUCT_MAKEFILES" is assigned
# with the value of product makefile path, variable "PRODUCT_DEVICE" should be defined in
# the product makefile or files included by this file.
#
# 2. second, "BoardConfig.mk" is included. This file should be found under "build/make/target/"
# or "device/" or "vendor/" with $(PRODUCT_DEVICE) in its subpath.
#
# 3. third, "AndroidBoard.mk" is included, this file is not a must, if it exists, it should
# be under the same directory as "BoardConfig.mk"


# In this sample config file, "AndroidProducts_root" is the directory under which
# "AndroidProducts.mk" can be found.
#
# "device" in this configuration file corresponds to "PRODUCT_DEVICE" variable defined in
# makefile, it's a substring of the path under which "BoardConfig.mk" and "AndroidBoard.mk"
# can be found. Although these files can be put in other path under "device/" or "vendor/"
# with $(PRODUCT_DEVICE) as subpath, we put these files under the path represented by
# "AndroidProducts_root", so in this example, the path should be:
#     device/vendor_name/product_family/board_name
#
# "name" corresponds to "PRODUCT_NAME" in makefile. the name of product makefile(used in
# "AndroidProducts.mk") can be deduced from "name", in this example, it's "product_name.mk".
# Although it can be put in any other path, we put this file under the same directory as
# "BoardConfig.mk", so the path should be:
#     device/vendor_name/product_family/board_name/product_name.mk

# To disable any module in the target product, change the "y" after the module name to other
# value.
